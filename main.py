#Establishing Static Meal Ingredient Variables Used
'''
The meatballs and patties will both be using the same meat supply,
so that needs to be taken into account.

Additionally, ingredient amounts will be listed as per serving.
The types of measurements will vary from pounds to ounces.
'''
#buns will be considered separate in this program

cheese = 1
spaghetti = 2
sauce = 4
meatball = .03
potato = .63
macaroni = 2
lettuce = 1
carrot = .25
crouton = 5
onion = .5
tomato = 5
#salt will be tricky, and to make it simple, we'll use the same per dish (tsp)
salt = .5

#Establishing Bulk Orders
'''This area is to keep track of how much of the starting bulk supply of the ingredients is. This will be handy when figuring out when is a good time to start ordering more ingredients. Keep in mind that bulk patty will cover the meat necessary for meatballs as well. The types of measurements will vary from pounds to ounces.
*will be represented as b_'''

'''Box will be measured by how many individual packs fit into the measurement box (the cardboard box in my room). 
For Example: 
1 pack of hamburger buns contains 8 buns (as half). The box in my room will hold 9 packs.
Box Bun order would be 9x8: 72 buns(top and bottom)'''

Also keep in mind that you will need variables to keep track of the ingredients that were used throughout the day, but this could be part of your randomization function. You just need to make sure to return the value and that it subtracts from the bulk order

Sample conditional: psuedocode
if stock_item is less than or equal to 1/3 of the bulk order: 
  Restaurant should put in an order.

#program works by the week, but make sure to add user input so that the program can run based off of choice. 
#May also need to adjust a day-to-day code that can check more specifically when to put in a restock order.
#for example: LOOP 
###run a check for the list[0] orders. restock where needed, .pop the list[0], then run it again. Print out the ingredient supply, maybe list the percentage of ingredient left, and in the restock statement, say what was ordered for restock.
